\frametitle{Inductive Reasoning (Bottom-Up Logic)}

Forming a general rule or conclusion from specific examples or observations. This conclusion is likely, but not necessarily true.

\begin{block}{Simple Example}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Observation 1:} I am a saggitarian. I spill coffee \verb|;)|
    \item \textbf{Observation 2:} My uncle is a saggitarian and he spills coffee
    \item \textbf{Inductive Conclusion:} Therefore, many saggitarians probably spill coffee.
  \end{itemize}
\end{block}

LLMs excel at generalizing from observed patterns but might not invent entirely novel hypotheses far beyond their training data.
